/*
  # Update All Tables RLS Policies for Anonymous Access

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive RLS policies that require authenticated Supabase users
    - Add permissive policies that allow anon access for all tables
    
  2. Tables Updated
    - requests
    - agents
    - messages
    - typing_indicators
    - claims
    
  3. Security
    - RLS remains enabled for all tables
    - Policies allow anon role access since app authentication is handled separately
    - This allows the app to function without Supabase authentication
