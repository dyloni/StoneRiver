  # Update Customers Table RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive RLS policies that require authenticated Supabase users
    - Add permissive policies that allow anon access since the app has its own auth layer
    
  2. Security
    - RLS remains enabled for the table
    - Policies allow anon role access since app authentication is handled separately
    - This allows the app to function without Supabase authentication
