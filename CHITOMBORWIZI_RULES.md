# Chitomborwizi Funeral Package Rules

The Chitomborwizi Funeral Cover is a family-based plan designed to provide affordable funeral protection.
Each package includes the policyholder, spouse, and up to 4 biological children under a single family premium.
Extended family members or non-biological dependents can also be added at a small additional cost.

## Package Pricing

| Package | Base Family Rate | Extra Dependent Rate | Coverage |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|----------|
| Lite | $5.00 | $2.50 | Policyholder + Spouse + up to 4 biological children |
| Standard | $8.00 | $4.00 | Policyholder + Spouse + up to 4 biological children |
| Premium | $15.00 | $7.50 | Policyholder + Spouse + up to 4 biological children |

## Premium Calculation Rules

### Base Coverage (Included in Base Rate)
- Policyholder (Self)
- Spouse
- Up to 4 biological children

### Extra Dependent Charges
Extra dependents are charged at the package's extra dependent rate:

**Lite Package:** $2.50 per extra dependent
**Standard Package:** $4.00 per extra dependent
**Premium Package:** $7.50 per extra dependent

**Who is an extra dependent?**
1. Biological children beyond the first 4 (e.g., 5th child, 6th child, etc.)
2. Sibling (not included in base coverage)
3. Parent (not included in base coverage)
4. Other non-biological dependents (grandparent, niece, nephew, cousin, etc.)

### Biological Children Definition
For the purpose of this policy, "biological children" include:
- Child
- Stepchild
- Grandchild

These relationships count toward the 4-child base coverage.

**Note:** Sibling and Parent relationships are NOT included in the base coverage and are charged as extra dependents.

### Premium Calculation Formula
```
Total Funeral Premium = Base Rate + (Extra Dependents × Extra Dependent Rate)

Where Extra Dependents =
  (Biological Children beyond 4) + (All Non-biological Dependents)
```

### Examples

**Example 1: Lite Package**
- Policyholder + spouse + 4 biological children + 2 nieces
- Calculation: $5.00 + (2 nieces × $2.50) = $10.00

**Example 2: Standard Package**
- Policyholder + spouse + 4 biological children + 1 extra biological child
- Calculation: $8.00 + (1 extra child × $4.00) = $12.00

**Example 3: Premium Package**
- Policyholder + spouse + 5 biological children + 1 cousin
- Calculation: $15.00 + (1 extra child × $7.50) + (1 cousin × $7.50) = $30.00
